# A Emacs+Clojure container for the lazy

## What do you need

* Docker
* Time to learn how to use Emacs

## How to run

Run `./start-emacs`

If it's your first time, a docker image will be build then it will run. If the
image already exists, it will only run.

Once you're in the bash, run `emacs` and have fun.
